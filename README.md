### Run on Server
To make your life easier during development, I recomend running this site through a local server. A lot of javascript functions cannot be sent as local request and need the 'http' or 'https' to function properly.
This can be done by installing 'http-server':
<p style="color:#ffff00; text-align: center;">npm install http-server -g</p>
<p>The '-g' suffix installs it on the entire machine, rather than just that individual code. Then you start the server by running this command in the terminal:</p>
<p style="color:#ffff00; text-align: center;">http-server "filepath"</p>
<p> Alternatively, you can simply run <mark style="background-color:#000000; color:#ffff00">'http-server'</mark> after navigating to your desired repository in the terminal.</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">If I ever bothered to learn to use docker, it's likely this would all be irrelavent.</p>
